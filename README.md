# Austin McConnell's Python Blog

This is my personal python blog where I write about all things Python and some things Raspberry Pi.

See the live version [here](https://austinmcconnell.github.io)

It is based on the [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) Jekyll theme by Michael Rose.
