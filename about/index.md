Howdy! I'm a Python software engineer who enjoys tinkering in the Development and Operations sides of the house. I began learning Python back in 2014 and loved it from the first moment.  I'm starting a blog to help me focus on learning and teaching intermediate and advanced aspects of the language. I also enjoy building things with a Raspberry Pi.

### Projects:
* [mortgage](https://github.com/austinmcconnell/mortgage), a simple package to make the lifetime cost of a mortage easier to understand.
* [pycon-sponsors](https://github.com/austinmcconnell/pycon-sponsors), a web scraper built with scrapy that collects all sponsors from pycon and stores them in a database
