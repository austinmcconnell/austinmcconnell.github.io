Howdy! I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2011 with an Aerospace Engineering degree and quickly discovered a knack for coding. I love the freedom found in writing software that can dramatically increase efficiency and automate the boring stuff.

#### Matlab

At my first job out of college, I started learning Matlab and successfully developed with it for about 2 years. At that point I had grown enough in my skills that I began thinking about writing applications on the side. Maybe start a side-business around a useful app, or even freelance.

I quickly ran into a big wall that I naively did not expect: licensing costs. At the time, one year of a commercial Matlab license clocked in at $2000. Yikes! That certainly would not do. Especially as I didn't know if any of my ideas would pan out.

I wanted a free, easy to learn, easy to read, yet powerful programming language to play with on the side. After a couple weeks of research, I decided on Python and dove right in.

#### Python

Right away, I was hooked. Here I'd found a language that felt more natural and intuitive to learn. The code samples I found were generally much cleaner and more concise. Code lines read fairly close to how I would naturally talk about the procedure. It was a good fit for me.

I originally struggled with the indentation requirement and lack of open/close brackets for functions. Then I remember how I used to auto-indent my code in Matlab anyway. Python just forced me to write it correctly the first time. And the lack of brackets reduced the "required clutter" of scripts.

I started learning as much as I could about the Python language, but my progress was slower than I would have liked until I attended the PyTexas conference in 2015.

### PyTexas

This was my first software conference and it was fantastic to meet people of a similar mindset. They got excited just like I did when learning about an awesome new feature or use case.

I learned so much at that conference. It was the coding equivalent of a tall mug of coffee. After the conference I was implementing things I hadn't even and heard about a few days before. And I was able to visit my alma mater as well! Unfortunately, there has not been another PyTexas conference since 2015 and I have not been able to figure out why.

After not attending any Python conferences in 2016, I've resolved to not let that happen again in 2017. I'm planning on attending the big kahuna of Python conferences. That's right, PyCon 2017 in Portland, Oregon!

### PyCon

I'm very much looking forward to this conference. I've watched many of the talks from years past on pyvideo.org. I've heard countless stories about how great a conference it is. And I've always wanted to visit Portland.

If you are attending PyCon this year as well, please reach out and let me know! I would love to chat with others who have been before and meet up at the conference.

### This Blog

I have big plans for this blog. I plan on writing about the mini-projects I attempt, the exporatory scripts to try out new packages, and general articles about my progress learning more about Python.

There is a good chance I'll also occasionally post about cool things I'm doing with my Raspberry Pi's.

If you like a blog post or want me to write about a specific topic, please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/austin_s_mcc) and let me know. That's all for now, so be on the lookout for new articles to appear shortly!
